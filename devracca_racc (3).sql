Each lesson will cover English, however basic maths skills will also be embedded. This may take the form of creating graphs, writing timelines and comparing statistics in texts. \r\n\r\nWhat if I need additional learning support (ALS)?\r\nIf you are diagnosed with any mental or physical health difficulty that affects your work, inform your tutor or RACC’s ALS support coordinator. The college runs weekly drop-ins for both ALS advice and learner well-being if you are in need of support. Your teacher can support you in receiving a dyslexia diagnosis if needed and one to one English ALS support is available as well as revision drop-ins throughout the year. \r\n\r\nWhat is Moodle?\r\nMoodle is the college’s student intranet system. It can be accessed from home and acts as a link between you and your tutor for independent study. Resources and home study activities will be uploaded to Moodle weekly and you will need to log-in regularly. You will also find useful information such as the course outline and termly plans here. \r\n\r\nWhere will a GCSE in English take me?\r\nGCSE English is recognised as the national standard for school-leavers and along with maths, is required by thousands of employers across the country. You will also need GCSEs to enter university or enrol on an Access to Higher Education course. English is invaluable for your future no matter what you are aiming for. A good command of spoken and written word will help you every day and benefit any other subjects you study.

But s/he is not exceptionally good; nor, at the other extreme, is s/he wicked or depraved.

This error is what leads to his/her downfall. The error entails harm to someone close to him/her.  4) S/he later experiences a painful realisation of the error.  5) The tragic spectacle is intended to produce the emotions of pity and fear in the audience; but with the aim, not of eradicating these feelings in the audience after they have been evoked, but of evoking them in such a way as to restore them to a balanced and rational level in the audience. \r\n       Then a statement of intention to examine the extent to which these features apply to the protagonists in the four Shakespearean tragedies: Hamlet, Othello, King Lear and Macbeth.\r\n\r\nWeek Two: A brief revision of Aristotle’s 5 points (as above).

His contention that morality, as a human creation, has a basis in emotion. The point that this emotivist viewpoint challenges the entire rationalist tradition in moral thinking.\r\n\r\nWeek Two: Nietzsche’s argument that the emotions which lie at the basis of morality are those which he associates with what he calls ‘the will to power’—the urge of all living things to express their energy. The link he makes between will to power and fitness for biological survival. The controversial character of this criterion for defining biological fitness.\r\n\r\nWeek Three:  The clash between Nietzsche’s concept of evolutionary ethics and the Christian view of ethics. More points on the differences between Nietzsche’s values and those of Christianity. Also, beyond the reference to Christianity, Nietzsche’s opposition to communal-humanitarian values.\r\n\r\nWeek Four: In contrast to Nietzsche’s arguments against communal-humanitarian values, moral arguments made by him which can be considered worthy of attention. His objection to: social conditions are too comfortable; to extremes of egalitarianism, and to cults of ordinariness.\r\n\r\nWeek Five: Again in positive comment, Nietzsche’s view of a new kind of exceptional individuality which he sees emerging in European culture; the continuing relevance of this view. However, the negative comments that must be made on what Nietzsche calls ‘master-morality,’ which he regards as superior to ‘slave-morality.’ A brief critique of ‘master-morality’ is given. \r\n\r\nWeek Six: Introduction to GM, emphasising that this book continues thetopic, begun in BGE, of the differences between ‘master-morality’ and ‘slave-morality.’ Nietzsche’s arguments about the class-origins of the two moralities—the former coming, he alleges, from a blood aristocracy and the latter from a plebeian class. \r\n\r\nWeek Seven:  Nietzsche’s contention that, while ‘master-morality’ is an overt, direct and honest expression of the will to power, ‘slave-morality’ is a covert, indirect and dishonest expression of that will. Nietzsche links ‘slave morality’ to Christianity, and laments that, in his view, this morality has now triumphed in modern culture. But he hopes that ‘master morality’ may yet re-assert itself.\r\n\r\nWeek Eight:  In connection with his negative view of ‘slave morality’ and Christianity, Nietzsche’s argument about the origins of ‘bad conscience’. His endorsement of ancient Greek religion and morality. Also, his praise for an ascetic way of life, but one quite separate from the Christian outlook and having close connections with the life-style of the atheistic philosopher.\r\n\r\nWeek Nine:  Having previously defended one kind of ascetic life-style, Nietzsche now attacks another kind—that of the “priestly caste,” as found, he says, in all religions. This kind he pillories as anti-natural and perverse. As a riposte to it, he offers the image of the man who combines bodily soundness with intellectual strength.\r\n\r\nWeek Ten: A recapitulative discussion on Nietzsche’s views about asceticism. Then a general revision of all points which have arisen in the course and to which students wish to return, for further consideration.    \r\n', ' ', 'Other Philosophy  courses.', '<a href="http://www.racc.ac.uk/how-enrol">How to Enrol</a>\r\n\r\n', '<a href="http://www.racc.ac.uk/course-fees">How to Pay for Your Course</a>\r\n', NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, 'BIT', 20, b'0', b'0', '\0', 0, 'G', 0),

One core and three specialist units, each with a different focus, will be covered*, as follows:\r\n•	Visual Recording in Art and Design \r\n•	3D Design Media, Techniques and Technology\r\n•	Art & Design Specialist Contextual Investigation \r\n•	Large Scale Design \r\n* not necessarily in the order listed above – units may be taught concurrently or overlap.\r\n', 'This course is designed to follow on from the BTEC L2 Certificate in Interior (3D) Design, or for those with equivalent experience in Interior Design (ie approximately one year studying one day per week). An understanding of perspective, scale drawing and model making is essential, as is a passion for interior design and a willingness to experiment with new materials and techniques. Previous art and design experience (eg life drawing, painting, illustration etc) is highly desirable. No knowledge of Autocad/Sketch Up is necessary as you will learn these programs to some extent during the course. \r\nThis is essentially a practical, project-led course of learning, not a theoretical or lecture-driven course, so you must be prepared to study and progress your projects independently, both inside and outside the class.\r\nOne-to-one tuition will be given and an individual learning plan drawn up to help you achieve your personal goals.\r\n', '\r\nThe course aims to develop the skills, knowledge and understanding needed to design effective and creative interior solutions using appropriate techniques and materials.\r\n\r\nThere is one core unit which spans the year, and three selected specialist units as follows:\r\nCore unit 1: Visual Recording in Art and Design\r\nThis unit aims to extend learners’ ability to select and visually record from a range of sources in order to communicate information to different audiences, using appropriate presentation methods and for a range of specific purposes. \r\nLearners will build their visual language skills and understanding through using the formal elements (line, tone, colour, shape, pattern, surface, structure etc) in a wide range of visual studies activities, developing the ability to identify and select for different purposes appropriate visual qualities from direct observation. Understanding the process of exploring and recording will involve experimenting with mark-making using varied materials, techniques and processes appropriate to interior design. \r\n \r\n\r\nSpecialist unit 2:  3D Design Media, Techniques and Technology\r\nThe aim of this unit is to encourage learners to develop the skills, understanding and knowledge of working with a range of 3D materials in order to fully realise the potential of their ideas. \r\nOn completion of this unit learners will:\r\n•	Know about the characteristics and properties of 3D materials \r\n•	Be able to investigate 3D media, techniques and technology \r\n•	Be able to use 3D media, techniques and technology safely \r\n•	Understand own use of 3D media, techniques and technology. \r\nSpecialist Unit 3:  Art & Design Specialist Contextual Investigation\r\nThis unit aims to develop learners’ skills, knowledge and understanding, investigating contemporary and historical practice in art, craft and design relevant to their specialist pathway (in this case Interior Design). Learners will gain an insight into different practitioners’ ideas and approaches and will use their research to inform and inspire their own practice. \r\nOn completion of this unit learners will: \r\n•	Know how the work of historical and contemporary specialist practitioners can influence current practice \r\n•	Understand the context in which specialist work was produced \r\n•	Understand the function, purpose and qualities of creative specialist work \r\n•	Be able to evaluate, structure and present findings. \r\nSpecialist Unit 4:  Large Scale Design\r\nThe aim of this unit is to develop learners’ skills in large-scale design. \r\nIt enables learners to explore and experiment with the manipulation of ideas and models in specialised areas of study such as architecture and interior design, environmental design, exhibition and display design, urban design and landscape design. \r\nOn completion of this unit learners will:\r\n•	Understand a brief for a large-scale design project\r\n•	Be able to develop design ideas for a large-scale design project\r\n•	Be able to produce design ideas for a large-scale design project\r\n•	Know how to review working methods used to realise outcomes for a large-scale design project. \r\nAll units require learners to develop and present creative ideas in response to a brief. You will evaluate your own and others'' work in terms of aesthetic values, innovative values, functionality and fitness for purpose.\r\n\r\nThis is a project-led course in which you will learn through practical demonstration, formal instruction and individual tuition, but primarily by working towards your individual design solution to a given brief. \r\n', 'Your progress will be assessed through in-class observation and your final grade determined on submission of your coursework folder.', ' ', 'Memory stick.Pen and paper', 'Regular attendance required.', 'This course could usefully be taken in conjunction with other interior design courses such as Autocad, SketchUp, Upcycling etc, or with other art and design courses such as graphic design (including digital design programs such as Photoshop and Illustrator), as well as traditional drawing, painting, illustration, ceramics, glass and woodwork courses.\r\nPlease ask your course tutor for advice during the course.\r\n', '<a href="http://www.racc.ac.uk/how-enrol">How to Enrol</a>', '<a href="http://www.racc.ac.uk/course-fees">How to Pay for Your Course</a>\r\n', '1', NULL, 'AAD', 165, b'0', b'0', '\0', 0, 'G', 0),
